    <p>This recipe is incredibly simple, the ingredients are measured to serve two people. If there will be a third, increase each ingredient bu 1.5. For a serving of 4, double each ingredient</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>40g red chilli relish</li>
    <li>1 tsbp cornflour</li>
    <li>130g white long grain rice</li>
    <li>5g toasted sesame seeds</li>
    <li>160 blanched peas</li>
    <li>2 carrots</li>
    <li>30ml soy sauce</li>
    <li>5g black sesame seeds</li>
    <li>320g skinless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1 spring onion</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove</li>
    <li>vegtable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air. In the meantime, top, tail, peel and dice the carrots finely</li>
        <li>Add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml [450ml] cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat. Once boiling, add the diced carrot and reduce the heat to very low, then cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked. Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</li>
        <li>Combine the cornflour and half of the soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!) in a bowl. Add the chicken thighs and give everything a good mix up until fully coated. Boil half a kettle.</li>
        <li>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat. Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 2 min on each side or until lightly browned. While the chicken is browning, combine the honey, chilli relish and 30ml (60ml] cold water in a small bowl -  this is your sweet chilli sauce</li>
        <li>Peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic. Once the chicken has browned, turn the heat down to medium-low and add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 min or until slightly softened. Add the sweet chilli sauce to the pan and cover with a lid. Cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened</li>
        <li>Trim, then slice the spring onion. Add the blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them. Once the rice is cooked, add the refreshed peas, black sesame seeds and remaining soy sauce and mix everything together - this is your veg-packed rice</li>
        <li>Once done, transfer the chicken to a clean board and shred it apart, using two forks - this technique is known as "pulling". Return the pulled chicken with the toasted sesame seeds to the pan and give everything a good mix up - this is your sweet chilli chicken. Tip: Add a splash of water if your sauce is looking a little thick! Serve the veg-packed rice in bowls with the sweet chilli chicken over the top. Sprinkle over the sliced spring onion. Enjoy!</li>
